\title{Predicting Stock Market with Bayesian Neural Network}


\begin{document}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
The randomness of stock market challenge investments to be reliable. Many of approaches has been introduced to find the hidden pattern behind the transitions. However, error estimation with non-parametric method is in the early stage. In this project, we used Bayesian neural network to predict discrete  time-series data with moving window of kernel. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain method is applied to measure the posterior distribution. The purpose is to provide a model-free approach with uncertainty quantification that is essential to the investment strategy.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}



\section{Dataset}

\paragraph{The dataset} contains the closing price per day for 4 stocks in 4 countries (Table \ref{tab:my_label}). These discrete time-series data is processed by normalization ($x_{i}' = \frac{x_{i} - x_{\min}}{x_{\max} - x_{\min}}$). The dataset is labeled by two timeframes: before and during COVID-19. Suppose the closing stock price is $[x_1, \dots, x_N]$ where $N$ is the length of the time series, the purpose is to predict the time series after the first few days of COVID-19 spreading.
